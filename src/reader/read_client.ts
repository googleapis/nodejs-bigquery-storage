   *
   * A particular row can be read by at most one stream. When the caller has

   * assigning data is collections of rows, the API does not guarantee that
   * each stream will return the same number or rows. Additionally, the
   * limits are enforced based on the number of pre-filtered rows, so some
   * filters can lead to lopsided assignments.

   * Read sessions automatically expire 6 hours after they are created and do
   * not require manual clean-up by the caller.

   *   of `projects/{project}/datasets/{dataset}/tables/{table}`.
