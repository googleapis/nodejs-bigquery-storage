   * the rows to be returned.
   *
   * A particular row can be read by at most one stream. When the caller has
   * reached the end of each stream in the session, then all the data in the
   * table has been read.
   *
   * Data is assigned to each stream such that roughly the same number of
   * rows can be read from each stream. Because the server-side unit for
   * assigning data is collections of rows, the API does not guarantee that
   * each stream will return the same number or rows. Additionally, the
   * limits are enforced based on the number of pre-filtered rows, so some
   * filters can lead to lopsided assignments.

   * Read sessions automatically expire 6 hours after they are created and do
   * not require manual clean-up by the caller.
