    > Node.js idiomatic client for [BigQuery Storage](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).

    The BigQuery Storage product is divided into two major APIs: Write and Read API. 
    BigQuery Storage API does not provide functionality related to managing BigQuery 
    resources such as datasets, jobs, or tables.

    The BigQuery Storage Write API is a unified data-ingestion API for BigQuery. 
    It combines streaming ingestion and batch loading into a single high-performance API.
    You can use the Storage Write API to stream records into BigQuery in real time or 
    to batch process an arbitrarily large number of records and commit them in a single 
    atomic operation. 

    Read more in our [introduction guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-api).

    Using a system provided default stream, this code sample demonstrates using the 
    schema of a destination stream/table to construct a writer, and send several 
    batches of row data to the table.

    ```javascript
    const {adapt, managedwriter} = require('@google-cloud/bigquery-storage');
    const {WriterClient, JSONWriter} = managedwriter;

    async function appendJSONRowsDefaultStream() {      
      const projectId = 'my_project';
      const datasetId = 'my_dataset';
      const tableId = 'my_table';

      const destinationTable = `projects/${projectId}/datasets/${datasetId}/tables/${tableId}`;
      const writeClient = new WriterClient({projectId});

      try {
        const writeStream = await writeClient.getWriteStream({
          streamId: `${destinationTable}/streams/_default`,
          view: 'FULL'
        });
        const protoDescriptor = adapt.convertStorageSchemaToProto2Descriptor(
          writeStream.tableSchema,
          'root'
        );

        const connection = await writeClient.createStreamConnection({
          streamId: managedwriter.DefaultStream,
          destinationTable,
        });
        const streamId = connection.getStreamId();

        const writer = new JSONWriter({
          streamId,
          connection,
          protoDescriptor,
        });

        let rows = [];
        const pendingWrites = [];

        // Row 1
        let row = {
          row_num: 1,
          customer_name: 'Octavia',
        };
        rows.push(row);

        // Row 2
        row = {
          row_num: 2,
          customer_name: 'Turing',
        };
        rows.push(row);

        // Send batch.
        let pw = writer.appendRows(rows);
        pendingWrites.push(pw);

        rows = [];

        // Row 3
        row = {
          row_num: 3,
          customer_name: 'Bell',
        };
        rows.push(row);

        // Send batch.
        pw = writer.appendRows(rows);
        pendingWrites.push(pw);

        const results = await Promise.all(
          pendingWrites.map(pw => pw.getResult())
        );
        console.log('Write results:', results);
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      } finally {
        writeClient.close();
      }
    }
    ```

    The BigQuery Storage Read API provides fast access to BigQuery-managed storage by 
    using an gRPC based protocol. When you use the Storage Read API, structured data is 
    sent over the wire in a binary serialization format. This allows for additional 
    parallelism among multiple consumers for a set of results.

    ### Apache Arrow Picosecond Precision Limitation
    Please note that the Apache Arrow JavaScript library currently does not support picosecond precision (`Timestamp[ps]`) logical types.
    When using the Storage Read API with Arrow format, if picosecond precision is requested, the Node.js client library will automatically fall back to microsecond precision and log a warning to prevent deserialization errors.
